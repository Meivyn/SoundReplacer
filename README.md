## Installation
Install the mod with your mod manager or get it from the [releases page](https://github.com/SamuelTulach/SoundReplacer/releases), then extract the zip file to your Beat Saber install directory. Make sure that you have core mods installed (BSIPA, BSML).

## Usage
First, you will need to find sounds that you want to use. They have to be in OGG/MPEG/WAV format. Please note that certain sounds should have offset, otherwise it might seem like the sound is played before the action happens. To download ready to use sounds, check out [BSMG Discord's](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods) `#game-sounds` section.

Once you have sounds that you want to use, simply move them to `Beat Saber\UserData\SoundReplacer` (should be created automatically if you run the game with mod once). After you have done so, (re)start the game and choose which sounds you want to use in the in-game menu.
